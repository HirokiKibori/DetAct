Currently, this is a prototype! There will be changes in the future. (Finishing v1.0 is planed in 2022.)

## Description
DetAct is an example for using the framework [DetAct-Lib](https://github.com/HirokiKibori/DetAct-Lib). It's a service where you can connect clients and run behaviour-models by them. The communication to clients works over web-sockets with an own message-protocol. You can create and edit behaviour-models with an editor by using BTML.
## Example
There is a Test-client you can use to run stack-behaviour or queue-behaviour. Both models are existing in BTML.

(*On wiki-pages there will be more more in the future.*)

## Roadmap
There are many things to do until v1.0:
- add issues
- refractor code for received messages
- a better configuration
- change folder for models (gives the possibility to manage them with other programs)
- a structured management for models
- a better editor (maybe with graphical components)
- add the possibility to reduce trees and get a better representation of them
- remove jQuery and Bootstrap
- add a more generic Test-Client
- add documentation
